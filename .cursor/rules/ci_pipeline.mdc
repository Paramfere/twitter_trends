- All Python changes must pass `ruff --fix`, `black --check`, and `mypy src/` before merge.  
- Tests in `tests/` must run under pytest with `--cov` and meet 90% coverage.  
- Any new file must be referenced in `pytest.ini` or workflow YAML to avoid being untested.  
- CI workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Updates to it require a PR with two approvals.
