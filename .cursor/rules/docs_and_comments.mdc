- Every function must have a one-sentence docstring in Google style.  
- Public modules (`*.py` in `engines/`) need a top-level doc comment explaining purpose.  
- When you change behavior, update the `CHANGELOG.md` under the "Unreleased" section.  
- README.md must include one usage example for each CLI entrypoint.
